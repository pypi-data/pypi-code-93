## Usage

Once this plugin is [installed](../README.md#installation), just replace
the plugin name `simple` with `semiliterate` in your `mkdocs.yml` file.
It accepts all of the same parameters, so `mkdocs` will still work as before,
and you will have immediate access to all of the following extensions.
(Note that this documentation assumes a familiarity with the
[usage](https://athackst.github.io/mkdocs-simple-plugin/mkdocs_simple_plugin/plugin/)
of the `simple` plugin.)

### Inclusion syntax

While extracting content from a file (because it matches one of the
`semiliterate` patterns, rather than just one of the `include_extensions`),
an unescaped expression of the form

`{! FILENAME YAML !}`

(which may span multiple lines) will trigger file inclusion. The FILENAME may
be a bare word, in which case it cannot contain whitespace, or it may be
enclosed in single or double quotes. Note that FILENAME is interpreted relative
to the directory in which the file containing the `{! .. !}` expression
resides. The YAML is interpreted exactly as the extraction options to a
`semiliterate` item as
[documented](https://athackst.github.io/mkdocs-simple-plugin/mkdocs_simple_plugin/plugin/index.html#semiliterate)
for the `simple` extension, subject to the extensions below. The text
extracted from FILENAME is interpolated at the current location in the file
currently being written. Recursive inclusion is supported.

The simplest example of such an inclusion directive is just
`{! boilerplate.md !}`, which (because of the conventions for extraction
parameters) simply interpolates the entire contents of `boilerplate.md`
at the current location.

For an example that uses more of the extraction parameters, the current
version number of mkdocs-semiliterate is extracted into the
[Overview](../README.md) of this documentation via

` {! ../README.md extract: { start: 'repo:.*(\{!.*!\})', stop: '' }
terminate: Rationale
!}`

to take advantage of the beginning of the `setup.cfg` file:
```
{! ../setup.cfg terminate: long !}...
```

(and of course both of the code snippets just above are extracted into this
page with `{! ... !}`, as you can see in the
[source code](https://code.studioinfinity.org/glen/mkdocs-semiliterate/src/branch/main/mkdocs_semiliterate/plugin.py)
for the plugin.)

Note that a `{! ... !}` directive must be in a line that semiliterate would
normally copy. That is, semiliterate does not examine lines after
the `terminate` regexp, or when no mode of extraction is active.
It also doesn't check any text written from lines that match these
special expressions, including `start` and `stop`.
Moreover, on such normally-transcribed lines,
it's the text **after** the application of any semiliterate `replace`ments that
is checked for `{! ... !}`.

### Double-quoted filenames and Git extraction

Standard Python escape sequences in double-quoted filenames are interpreted
as usual; for example you can write
```
{! ../tests/fixtures/quoted-filename/README.md extract:
  start: '(.*!.*)'
  stop: '\s'
!}
```
to include a file whose name (`snippet/Say "Don't"`, in this case) has both
double and single quotes.

Further, `semiliterate` supports a special escape to extract a file from the
Git archive of the project (presuming it is under Git version control) and then
include content from that file. For example, you could write
```
{! ../tests/fixtures/git-inclusion/README.md extract:
  start: '(.*!.*)'
  stop: '\s'
!}
```

to extract content starting after the `### install` line from the
`mkdocs.yml` file in the Git commit of this repository
tagged `0.1.0`. This feature is primarily useful if you are documenting the
development or changes to a project over time, or are documenting a feature
in a specific past release of your project, and want to be sure that
material included in your documentation does _not_ change as the project
progresses. (This behavior is as opposed to the usual case, in which you want
your documentation to incorporate the most up-to-date version of extracted
content.)

The precise behavior for a FILENAME argument in a `{! ... !}` inclusion of the
form

`"\git SPECIFIER"`

is that the output of `git show SPECIFIER` is written to a temporary file,
and that file is extracted from.
