(Possibe feature feature?)\n\nPyAutoGUI provides a simple interface to the mouse, and Typer provides simple cli parsing. You can find out more about these libraries with the links provided above.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis package supports Python 3.6 through 3.9. It does not support any version of Python 2, nor any version of 3 lower than 3.6. Please upgrade our Python version, if possible.\n\nI highly recommend using [pipx][3] for installing standalone packages, as it adds a layer of isolation to your installation. But pip will also work.\n\n```bash\npipx install clickpy\n# -- or --\npip install clickpy\n```\n\nIf you're using macOS or Linux, you may have to install additional dependencies for PyAutoGUI to work properly. Please review their [docs][4] for additional information.\n\nWindows users don't have to install any additional software.\n\nTo uninstall, type in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npipx uninstall clickpy\n# -- or --\npip uninstall clickpy\n```\n\n## Running\n\nOnce this package is installed, and any additional dependencies too, run the app like so:\n\n```bash\nclickpy\n```\n\nTo stop it, press `ctrl+c`.\n\nThere are 3 flags you can use; `-d` will display debug information, `-f` will speed the app up to 1 click every second, and `--help` will display the help menu.\n\n## For Developers\n\nPlease read [contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about this repo, how it's maintained and developed. And feel free to make PRs.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui\n[2]: https://github.com/tiangolo/typer\n[3]: https://github.com/pypa/pipx\n[4]: https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/blob/master/docs/install.rst\n",
